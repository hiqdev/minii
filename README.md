Minii is not another framework - it's a testing playground.

**General goals:**

- split framework into components
- less specific dependencies, remove:
    - fxp/composer-asset-plugin (used hiqdev/composer-asset-plugin instead)
    - require Yii.php
- more PSR compatibility: PSR-3 and so on
- easier creation of console only applications

**Done:**

- splitted to parts: core, console, caching, i18n, web, mail, ...
- no more `composer global require fxp/composer-asset-plugin`, used `hiqdev/composer-asset-plugin`
- no more `require __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/yiisoft/yii2/Yii.php'`, done with composer
- no more classes.php, done with composer
- working for console apps
- compatible with PHAR packaging

**Changes to PR to yii2:**

- PHAR compatibility

**Changes to think of:**

- move helpers into other components:
    - Console to yii2-console
    - Html, Url to yii2-web
    - ArrayHelper, StringHelper, Inflector to ???
    - Markdown to yii2-markdown
    - VarDumper to yii2-debug
    - ...
- drop yii\mail\BaseMailer dependency on yii\web\View for it could be used for console only apps
- PSR-3 logging, remove log from core

**To do:**

- try split tests into components
- much more...
